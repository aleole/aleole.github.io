{% include base_path %}


My academic path has been closely aligned with the scientific objectives of the LISA and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations.

- Evolution of massive stars in isolated binary systems
- Evolutionary scenarios leading to the formation of binaries hosting compact objects
- Origin of gravitational wave signals 
- Stars in the galactic centers as multimessenger sources

Cartoon illustrating key stages: a binary disrupted by the supermassive black hole leaves one star bound and one ejected. The captured starâ€™s orbit circularizes, undergoes stable mass transfer as a sub-giant, then its stripped core inspirals further, becoming a bright LISA-band gravitational wave source. Adopted from Olejak et al. 2025.
