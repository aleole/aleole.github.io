{% include base_path %}


My academic path has been closely aligned with the scientific objectives of the LISA and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. My research interests include:
My expertise lies in stellar evolution, compact-object astrophysics, and gravitational-wave astronomy, with a particular focus on binary interactions that lead to the formation of GW sources. My research spans the full evolutionary pathway from stellar birth to compact-object mergers, combining detailed stellar and binary evolution codes (MESA, StarTrack) with population synthesis to connect theoretical predictions with GW detections (LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, LISA) and electromagnetic observations (e.g., Gaia black holes, X-ray binaries). During my postdoctoral fellowship at MPA, I began investigating systems where stars transfer mass onto supermassive black holes.

Cartoon illustrating key stages: a binary disrupted by the supermassive black hole leaves one star bound and one ejected. The captured star’s orbit circularizes, undergoes stable mass transfer as a sub-giant, then its stripped core inspirals further, becoming a bright LISA-band gravitational wave source. Adopted from Olejak et al. 2025.
