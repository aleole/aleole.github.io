{% include base_path %}


My academic path has been closely aligned with the scientific objectives of the LISA and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. My expertise lies in stellar evolution, compact-object astrophysics, and gravitational-wave astronomy, with a particular focus on binary interactions that lead to the formation of GW sources. My research spans the full evolutionary pathway from stellar birth to compact-object mergers, combining detailed stellar and binary evolution codes (MESA, StarTrack) with population synthesis to connect theoretical predictions with GW detections (LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA, LISA) and electromagnetic observations (e.g., Gaia black holes, X-ray binaries). During my postdoctoral fellowship at MPA, I began investigating systems where stars transfer mass onto supermassive black holes.

## Recent Highlights

Our recent review: **Zdziarski et al. (2026)** *Spins of black holes in X-ray binaries and the tension with the gravitational wave measurements*  **New Astronomy Reviews**, Volume 102, June 2026, 101746  has been published. It discusses the current understanding of black hole spin measurements in X-ray binaries and examines the emerging tension between these measurements and spin estimates inferred from gravitational-wave observations. We summarize observational techniques, systematic uncertainties, and the implications for compact-object formation and binary evolution.

Cartoon illustrating key stages: a binary disrupted by the supermassive black hole leaves one star bound and one ejected. The captured star’s orbit circularizes, undergoes stable mass transfer as a sub-giant, then its stripped core inspirals further, becoming a bright LISA-band gravitational wave source. Adopted from Olejak et al. 2025.
