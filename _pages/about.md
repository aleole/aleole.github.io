{% include base_path %}


My academic path has been closely aligned with the scientific objectives of the LISA and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations.

- Evolution of massive stars in isolated binary systems
- Evolutionary scenarios leading to the formation of binaries hosting compact objects
- Origin of gravitational wave signals 
- Stars in the galactic centers as multimessenger sources
